class APIContext(object):
    """The Event Scripting API Context

    A new instance of this class is given to each event script as an access point to the engine API.
    It is accessible via the "BXE" attribute given to every event script's main scope.
    For example, to access the AudioManager from an event script, its instance would be "BXE.audio".
    You can also access BXE like a dict, as a shorthand for "BXE.vars" which holds persistent variables.
    For example, "BXE['myvar']" is the same as "BXE.vars['myvar']".
    Note that class methods an event script should never call begin with an underscore.

    :ivar filename: The filename of the currently executing event script.
    :ivar app: The main App instance.
    :ivar audio: The AudioManager instance.
    :ivar cursor: The Cursor instance.
    :ivar database: The DatabaseManager instance.
    :ivar log: The Logger instance for this script.
    :ivar overlay: The OverlayManager instance.
    :ivar resource: The ResourceManager instance.
    :ivar script: The ScriptManager instance.
    :ivar tick: The TickManager instance.
    :ivar ui: The UI instance.
    :ivar world: The World instance.
    :ivar vars: The vars variable from the main App, used to share variables between event scripts.
    :ivar path: The relative path to this script, from the engine's base directory.
    :ivar dir: The directory this script is in.
